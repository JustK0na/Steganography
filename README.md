#Steganography 
is an art of hidding information in plain sight. Program above is using any image to conceal text message on last bit of every pixel. In that way altered picture is indistinguishable from original but still contains encrypted data.
Application is now only using red chanel, but will be developed to using whole rgb palette. Few first bytes contain information about length of message. Later several next bytes will carry information about type of file that is transported so more than just plain text could be used
